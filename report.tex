\section*{Abstract}
This project will simlulate several interesting models used in financial markets. We will start with the famous Black-Scholes' model with constant volatility. Secondly, Heston model will introduce stochastic volatility into the Black-Scholes' system. We will discuss some application of these models with respect to option pricing.
We will also discuss a simple model in ruin theory and systematic risk in banking system from stochastic approach.

The report will focus mainly on three topics 

\section{Black-Scholes' Economy}
The most basic model from the stochastic approach to model stock price is to use the Black-Schole-Merton Model. In this model, the stock price $(S_t)$ is given as
$$S_t = S_0 exp\left( (r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} )t + \sigma W_t \right)$$
where $r$ is the interest rate, $\sigma$ is the volatility of that stock and $W$ is the standard Brownian motion. Therefore the logarithm of the stock price is a Brownian motion with drift, namely 
$$\log(S_t) = \log(S_0) \times ((r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} )t + \sigma W_t )$$

As we will see later, computer simulation of the Brownian motion is crucial for some numerical methods to evaluate some financial assets, such as exotic options. 

There are several ways to simulate a standard Brownian motion. A straightforward approach is to use the first order Euler scheme and discretise the unit time to $N_{int}$ intervals. By the property of independent and stationary increments of Brownian motion, we can determine the distribution of the process at each point given its previous location. Mathematically, we denote $X$ as $\log(S_t)$ and
$$ \hat{X}_{(j+1)h} = \hat{X}_{jh} +( r-\frac{\sigma^2}{2})h +\sqrt{h} \sigma Z_{j+1}\  \forall j = 0, 1, \dots $$
where $h = \frac{1}{N_{int}}$ is the time interval between every sampling of the process and $Z_j$s are independent and identically distributed normal random variables with mean 0 and variance 1.

Given the same initial price and interest rate, the following figure(Figure. \ref{fig:1.stock_vs_vol})gives the histgram the the $\log(S_t)$ by several different volatilities.
