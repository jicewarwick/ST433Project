\section{Abstract}
This project will simlulate several interesting models used in financial markets. We will start with the famous Black-Scholes' model with constant volatility. Secondly, Heston model will introduce stochastic volatility into the Black-Scholes' system. We will discuss some application of these models with respect to option pricing.
We will also discuss a simple model in ruin theory and systematic risk in banking system from stochastic approach.

\section{Introduction}
% why simulation, benefit, ??
The report will focus mainly on three topics 

\section{Black-Scholes' Economy}
The most basic model in the stochastic approach to model stock price is the Black-Schole-Merton Model. In Black-Scholes' economy, the stock price $(S_t)$ is given as
$$S_t = S_0 exp\left( (r - \frac{\sigma^2}{2} )t + \sigma W_t \right)$$
where $r$ is the interest rate, sigma is the volatility of that stock and $W$ is the standard Brownian motion.
